## Penn State Behrend
### Digital Media, Arts, & Technology 

This is a site that was created for the senior class Digital Project Design. This website is created using Python, Flask, and Jinja Templating. Bootstrap was used for many of the buttons on the site and other elements to help keep the site accessible and mobile friendly!

The name of the site is the *Student Forum* and the url is [studentforum.club](https://studentforum.club/). 

## About
This project was created for DIGIT 400, a senior class at Pennsylvania State Erie, The Behrend College for a final project. This website is for current or new students who have questions about college. Students can create an account with their psu email and post to the dashboard asking questions that they have. The purpose for the creation of this site is because there is currently no place where students can go online to ask questions about college. This site was created in hopes of creating a community where students can go to ask questions without having to go into an office and speak to someone when they are already nervous about college.

### What does it do?
The functionality for this website includes a login page where a user/student can login. Once logged in, the student will be redirected to the message dashboard where they can post questions or answers to other questions to help other students out. 

### Purpose
This site was created because there is no current place where students can go online to ask questions about college life. On this message board, I hope to change this and have a community where students can feel safe asking questions about college that they have no one to ask. 

#### Future Plans
The future plans for this website include creating a profile for users, a messaging option inside the website, and the ability to share media on posts with other students. The goal is to get users to use the site enough that it becomes a community where students enjoy coming to discuss about college and questions that they have.
